<h1>Pool Area</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>In the same area as the gym is our large indoor swimming pool which, at a length of 16 metres, is perfect for swimming lengths. Skylights, massage jets and the waterfall make your swim extra luxurious. Afterwards, you can enjoy a sauna or relax on one of the large, comfortable loungers. There are individual changing cubicles with their own shower, lockers, towels and toilets.
The swimming pool is open every day from: 06:00 â€“ 22.00.</p>
